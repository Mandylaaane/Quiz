# Quiz
Project 1: JS/React Course

## Description
This project challenges you to build a fun and interactive quiz game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your quiz will ask multiple-choice questions and give players immediate feedback on their answers. A progress bar or scoreboard will show how many questions the player has answered correctly, and at the end of the quiz, they will see their final score.

## Requirements
- Structure the page with HTML to display the questions, answer options, and navigation buttons.
- Style the quiz using CSS so that itâ€™s easy to read and visually appealing.
- Use JavaScript to load questions one by one, handle user clicks on the answers, and show whether those answers are correct or incorrect.
- Work with async/await to fetch questions from Quiz API without making the page reload.
- Catch and handle errors so your quiz can gracefully tell users if something goes wrong, like missing data.
- Minimum 10 questions.
- Multiple choice answers.
- Any category and any difficulty level.
- Add comments where applicable.
- Deploy to Netlify.
- Deliverables
- GitHub repository containing all source code.
